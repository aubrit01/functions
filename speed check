# Write a function for checking the speed of drivers.
# This function should have one parameter: speed.
# If speed is less than 70, it should print "OK".
# Otherwise, for every 5 km above the speed limit of 70, it should give the driver one demerit point and print the total number of demerit points.
# For example, if the speed is 80, it should print: “2 points will go on your driving record”.
# f the driver gets more than 12 demerit points, the function should print: “License suspended”.

	if speed <= 70:
